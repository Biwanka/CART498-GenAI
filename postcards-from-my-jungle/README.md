Postcards From My Jungle is a fictional field notebook built from a diffusion-trained image model, a pre-trained audio generator, and a language prompt for invented animal speech. I had a lot of difficulty with the audio pipeline: access issues in Colab blocked runs, and I hit free GPU limits, so I ended up creating a new account just to finish the sound step. That frustration shaped how I worked—once the model finally ran, I focused on getting reliable outputs rather than perfecting every parameter.

For the images, I collected a wide dataset of different animals and trained a diffusion model in Google Colab. I tested multiple runs by changing dataset size and number of epochs. Sadly I was rendering thing on blender at the same time and my computer crashed a couple times that I lost my colabs as they didnt save any pf the changes (happened a couple times) Short runs underfit and looked washed out; longer runs improved texture but started to repeat shapes. I also tried a newer model version, but it consistently downsampled to 64x64, which made the images too blurry for the final gallery. I kept the best 16 images from the cleaner run and included the rest in the images folder for reference. 
I decided to make the other 50 images that I rendered as the ancestry (I found it would be a nice use of something that flop (and I spend whay to long rendering them))

For sound, I used a pre-trained diffusion audio model (Stable Audio Open). I generated multiple clips with different durations and iterated on the prompts by adding descriptive words and adjectives that evoke animal presence—things like “hollow,” “feathered,” “subterranean,” and “distant.” I selected four distinct calls that felt like separate species and kept extra variations in the sound folder. The fictional language uses a structured prompt that asked for short, phonetic phrases plus an English gloss. I generated 16 phrases and matched each to an image so the text reads like a living field guide.

To improve quality, I would train longer with a larger, better labeled dataset and use higher resolution checkpoints plus an upscaler pass. Adding class conditioning by species families could reduce repetition and improve anatomy. For audio, I would test longer generation windows, higher fidelity models, and do light post‑processing (EQ, reverb, noise shaping) to deepen the environment. For language, I would fix a phoneme inventory and grammar template so phrases become more consistent across the ecosystem.
