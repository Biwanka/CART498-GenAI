I had way to much difficulty with the sound, the access wastn working, it was a problem. For th image i tried to change the amount of epoch, if i used you model but a different dataset it came out ok. I used a big wide dtataset on different animals. I just passed it a couple times. I decided to do i try with a new verion but gemini always made it a 64x64 with a lower resolution, i still added the images in the folder image but they look blurry so i chose the first 16 imade before.
For the sound i just added different tipes of words or adjective for sounds for animals. I legit searched words on google and added I spent the whole day trying to generate the colab to work as it wasnt, i even had to make a new account as i had spent already the amount of gpu on a free account. I will say I was quite over it at this point.
