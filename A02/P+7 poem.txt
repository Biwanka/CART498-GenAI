Original Poem:
One must have a mind of winter
To regard the frost and the boughs
Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;
And have been cold a long time
To behold the junipers shagged with ice,
The spruces rough in the distant glitter
Of the January sun; and not to think
Of any misery in the sound of the wind,
In the sound of a few leaves,
Which is the sound of the land
Full of the same wind
That is blowing in the same bare place
For the listener, who listens in the snow,
And, nothing himself, beholds
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.

Modified Poem (Seventh highest probable word):
One must have a mind of her
To regard the frost and the death
Of the pine-trees crusted with oil
And have been cold a long few
To behold the junipers shagged with white
The spruces rough in the distant night
Of the January sun; and not to have
Of any misery in the sound of the sound
In the sound of a few shots
Which is the sound of the voice
Full of the same story
That is blowing in the same bare footed
For the listener, who listens in the following
And, nothing himself, I
Nothing that is not there and the nothing that isn
